## 1. Project Title
Task Scheduler using Heap Priority Queue

---

## 2. Introduction
This project implements a Task Scheduler that manages tasks based on their **priority** and **deadline**.  
A Heap is used to efficiently insert, delete, and organize tasks.

---

## 3. Objectives
- Manage tasks by priority  
- Simulate a real-world scheduling system  

---

## 4. Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** C++  
- **Data Structure:** Heap 

---

## 5. Project Working
The program takes the following input from the user:
- Task description  
- Deadline  
- Priority (High to Low)

It uses heap operations such as:
- heapify  
- insertion  
- deletion  
- swapping  

The highest priority task always stays at the top of the heap.

---

## 8. Conclusion
A Task Scheduler was successfully built using a Heap.  
This project demonstrates the use of heapify, insertion, deletion, and other DSA concepts.
